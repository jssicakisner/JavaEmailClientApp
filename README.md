# Java Email Client App

This is a Java-based email client application that allows users to send, receive, and manage emails from various email service providers.

## Features

- **Sending Emails:** Users can compose and send emails to recipients with attachments.
- **Receiving Emails:** Users can receive and view emails from their email accounts.
- **User Authentication:** Secure login functionality to authenticate users with their email accounts.
- **Graphical User Interface:** Intuitive and user-friendly graphical interface for easy navigation and interaction.

With an encapsulated email session management, the app can maintain a clean and efficient connection lifecycle and improve resource management, simplifying the process of accessing and displaying emails. 

Plus, this aligns with best practices for working with external resources, like email servers, by centralizing connection management and reducing redundancy in the codebase.
